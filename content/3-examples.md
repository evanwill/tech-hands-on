## Integrated Musicianship

Sean Butterfield of University of Idaho, with support of the [Think Open Fellowship](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/c.php?g=772392&p=5540605) and Evan Williamson, created an interactive music textbook:

- [Integrated Musicianship: Theory](https://intmus.github.io/inttheory18-19/){:target="_blank"} 
- [IntMus Theory source code](https://github.com/intmus/inttheory18-19){:target="_blank"} on GitHub
- Interactive features:
    - Live note taking during class discussion (e.g. [Labeling Pitches](https://intmus.github.io/inttheory18-19/01-pitches-clefs/b2-labelingpitches.html)). Student learning becomes part of the textbook!
    - [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs){:target="_blank"} enables live editable music examples in the text (e.g. [Happy Birthday in G major](https://intmus.github.io/inttheory18-19/02-int-scales-keys/b1-scales.html){:target="_blank"}).
    - [Disqus](https://disqus.com/){:target="_blank"} (discussion around assignments, e.g. [Unit 4 assignment](https://intmus.github.io/inttheory18-19/assignments/Fall-semester/2018-09-17.html){:target="_blank"})

Freed from many of the limitations of a conventionally published text, we were able to add innovative features to enrich the learning experience and flexibly adapt to the needs of the course and students.
Importantly, these interactive features and responsive workflow in creating the textbook compliment the philosophy of inquiry-based learning, a "flipped-classroom" driven by students' exploration and examination of the subject.
In this case, GitHub provides an ideal platform not only for project management, collaboration, and sharing source code, but also for implementing an actively evolving textbook informed by an inquiry-based pedagogical method.

## Workshops

`workshop-template-b` is a Jekyll project to create a simple workshop website, with a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/){:target='_blank'} theme, designed for hosting on [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target='_blank'}.

It works best for about 5 pages of instructions, plus index, all written in Markdown. 
The navigation to the main pages is exposed at top and bottom of each page for easy stepping through the lessons.

Rather than making slides for a workshop, why not make a website? 
It's easier to write, access, share, and reuse. 
GitHub and gh-pages makes this super easy.

It is a better [Open Educational Resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources){:target='_blank'} since anyone can easily fork and adapt!

easier to follow tech walk through with code right in front of user, rather than off on the screen.
