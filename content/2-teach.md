# Teaching

{% include figure.html img="color-color-paper-colored-paper-268347.jpg" alt="sticky notes by rawpixels.com" %}

## Instructor Prep

- [Instructor Training materials](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), community discussions, mentoring groups
- Practice with video!
- Have clear install / setup solutions
    - bring USB with required downloads
    - include instructions for all OS and emergency alternatives
    - learn from others about common problems 
- Session leader + helpers

## Environment 

Establish a safe space for learning 

- [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) - foster a welcoming, supportive environment to learn (and fail)
- Peer teachers create a more comfortable learning environment
    - instructors and helpers are often peer researchers, and are learners as well
    - participants pair up on exercises, encourage helping each other
    - pair programming
- Prep your vocabulary
    - Avoid "easy" and "just" - recognize barriers and demystify, sensitive to impostor syndrome
    - Avoid "dismissive language" of experts - don't demean certain applications, OS, etc. 
    - "What questions do people have?"
    - Acknowledge confusion
    - Demotivating
- Understand learner motivations
    - Not CS. Teach what is useful!


## Sticky Notes

Participants receive red and green sticky notes used for communicating feedback during the sessions. 

- Red sticky note = non-intrusive, discreet means to get help
- *Once you get to X put up your Green sticky...*
- Instant assessment questions
    - identify misconceptions
- "Minute Cards"
    - Continuous feedback built in to the end of each session 
    - Write down one positive, one negative, remaining questions
    - instructors review during breaks and address = responsive to learners. Be explicit so learners know you are listening!

## Participatory Live Coding

- BYO Device - participants are most comfortable with their own machine, plus need to get it set up correctly for further research and learning.
- Real data - walk through concrete examples with realistic scenarios rather than abstract concepts. "media computing"
- Live Coding + Code-along
    - Continuous practice-feedback loop - teach from mistakes, the art of troubleshooting 
    - Speak out loud about everything you are doing! 
    - Model behavior, e.g. common shortcuts 
    - Go Slow! Help participants build "mental models" of how coding works, not cram them full of information.
    - Prep your machine: big fonts, accessible colors, notifications off, non-customized look
- Collaborative note taking 
    - Etherpad, Google Doc
    - Peer support, chat
    - links, resources, quiz answers
    - keep accessible after the session
- Reduce cognitive load 
    - Minimize window / app switching! 
    - Structure lessons to introduce only a handful of concepts at a time (use concept mapping to figure out how many things you are actually trying to introduce!)
    - Guided practice

## Assessment 

- Pre + post surveys for each workshop
- [long term impact survey](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/assessment/assessment.html)
- Research
- Evidence based practice
