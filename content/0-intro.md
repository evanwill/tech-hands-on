# Introduction

- Me ([Evan, Digital Infrastructure Librarian](http://vivo.nkn.uidaho.edu/vivo/individual/n43629){:target="_blank"})
- [Library Workshops](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/workshops/){:target="_blank"} 
- Background - 2016 Software Carpentry instructor training with [Northwest Knowledge Network](https://www.northwestknowledge.net/) 
    - Influenced how I teach and how I develop materials

### The Carpentries

The [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/){:target="_blank"} is an international volunteer organization that teaches basic tech skills for researchers, via workshops in three areas:

- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)
- [Data Carpentry](https://www.datacarpentry.org/)
- [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)

Computing and data skills are a growing part of every academic discipline making it necessary to incorporate in curriculum. 
The Carpentries fill the gaps in the basic training that can make research easier and more efficient--"to get more done in less time and with less pain" (Greg Wilson).
Importantly, they are committed to a particular method of teaching these skills that is informed by research and aims to build a positive learning community:

<p>The Carpentries develop and teach in-person, interactive, hands-on, two-day workshops for learning core data science and coding skills. Carpentries workshops are taught by volunteer Instructors, trained in pedagogy, who focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for learners. All our lessons are open source, hosted on GitHub, and collaboratively developed by our volunteer community.</p>

### Outline

1. Develop - look at the collaborative lesson development process, because I think these OER help enable active learning
2. Teach - review Carpentries methods for hosting interactive sessions
3. Examples - introduce some other example partly informed by these techniques
4. Resources - references to get started!
