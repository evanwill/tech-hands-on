# Reference

### GitHub <span class="fab fa-github"></span>

[GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} is a popular web service for hosting Git repositories--with benefits!
It provides a handy web interface for editing and collaborating on repos, as well as, built in project management features and [free static web hosting](https://pages.github.com/){:target="blank"} powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="blank"}.
Accounts are free.
To learn more check out Hello World on [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/){:target="_blank"} or [GitHub Training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/){:target="_blank"}.

### Jekyll 

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="blank"} is a popular static site generator that is built into [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="blank"} free web hosting service.

- [go-go gh-pages](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages/) (workshop)

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a standard to simplify writing content for the web. 
[GitHub markdown flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) can be used any where on GitHub and in Jekyll.

- [Markdown in a Minute](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/markdown-minute.html)
- GitHub Guide [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) (web based markdown editor)

# Text Editor

When working with code you should have a good text editor.
Windows notepad does not handle UTF-8 encoding or UNIX line endings that are standard for cross platform applications. 
For basic editing, Windows [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), Mac TextEdit, or Linux Gedit are sufficient.
However, a more complete code editor will be helpful for managing Jekyll projects.

Open-source cross platform suggestions:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
