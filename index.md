Teaching digital tools is often challenging for the instructor and intimidating for the learner. 
However, computing and data skills are a growing part of every discipline making it necessary to incorporate in curriculum. 

The [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) is an international volunteer organization that collaboratively develops lessons and teaches two day workshops to fill that gap and support foundational tech skills in research. 
Over two decades the community has collected experience and evidence based approaches to teaching this content in a workshop setting.

This session will introduce some of concepts and techniques that can be adapted to other instructional contexts to support active learning of difficult technical topics.
